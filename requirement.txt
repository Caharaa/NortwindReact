For a fast-developing ERP system, focusing on 5 core pages can help you get the essential functionalities up and running quickly. These pages are fundamental to most ERP systems and will form the backbone of the application. Here's a brief on the 5 core pages:

Start with basic KPI cards and charts (like total sales, orders, and stock levels).

Use libraries like Chart.js or recharts for basic graphs.

Focus on making the page clean and concise to quickly present data.
